At the end of module 3, the instructor Chiantu asked for a solution for the following scenario:

_ I have a file that is 50 lines long. I need a query that will show only lines 20-30. Using `head` and `tail`, give me a solution next week.

Here is my query:

```
$ tail -31 Head-Tail-Assignment-PriscilaH.txt | head -11
```
