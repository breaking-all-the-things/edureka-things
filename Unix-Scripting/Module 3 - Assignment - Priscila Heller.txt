## Assignment - Module 3

- Write the differences between Files, Directories and Sub-directories

  - File is a container to store contents, records and information.
  - Directory is a collection of files and sub-directories.
  - Sub-directories are directories within a directory.

- Without delete the contents of files how can you make the file as empty?

Here are a few options (please consider the file which will have its contents deleted to be called `delete_contents.txt`):

  - Option 1: $ > delete_contents.txt
  - Option 2: $ touch empty_file.txt; cp empty_file.txt delete_contents.txt


- Using pipe and re-direction, write some script/example

  $ cat exceptions.log | grep timeout > timeout_errors.txt

- Write a script to redirect the error message of a command in a file

  $ cat non_existent_file.txt 2> error.txt

- Differences between  "less" and "more" command

  - less command allows page scrolling forwards and backwards.
  - more command only allows forward scrolling.
  - less also does not read the whole file before it starts outputting its contents on the screen, so it is a good option for large files.

- Describe various types of file creation in Unix/Linux with differences

  - touch: can create one or many empty files with one single command i.e: $ touch file1 file2 file3
  - vi: similar to "touch", it can create single or multiple files. vi also creates the file in write/edit mode.
  - cat >: can create one file at a time in write mode.
